    <h2>What is Spiritual Direction?</h2>
    <p>Spiritual Direction is a place for thoughtful reflection to give our full attention to noticing the movements of God in our daily lives and cultivate more awareness around them.</p>

    <h2>What is the Enneagram?</h2>
    <p>The Enneagram is an ancient map of our internal operating system. It’s a tool and a resource to show us 9 different ways of showing up in the world and which one I default to. If I don’t know who I am, I can’t get out of my own way. It shows me where to look when I am stuck and how to shift by encouraging self-observation and presence and gives us insight about others so that we can engage in our relationships with more grace and love.</p>

      <h2>What is a Core Gift Discovery Interview?</h2>
      <p>Your Core Gift is the unique offering you have to share with others. It is connected to and strengthened by your life experiences—particularly your challenges. Knowing your Core Gift means you can better share it with others, provides focus to your sense of purpose and well-being, and guides your decision- making on the path forward. The interview takes about 90 minutes. The main part of the interview involves being asked questions that have no “right” answer. Your opinion is all that matters. After you answer the questions, you are guided through several more steps until you have identified your Core Gift. Your Core Gift statement is created out of your own words. It’s a powerful reflection of how you, uniquely, show up in the world and what matters most deeply to you.</p>

    <h2>Background and Training</h2>
    <p>I have a certificate in Spiritual Direction from Fall Creek Abbey School of Spiritual Direction in Indianapolis, IN and have been offering Spiritual Direction for the last 2 years. I was introduced to Spiritual Direction while I was completing my Enneagram Practitioner Certification in 2015. I felt drawn to the marriage of using a tool like the Enneagram to facilitate self-knowledge and greater awareness of the Divine, within and without. I am currently working on a 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training to further integrate deepening spiritual practices with the body and mind. Before that, I nurtured my 6 children and participated in their education full time for 25 years. Before that I worked with my Exercise Science degree in different capacities as a trainer and exercise therapist. I have always been involved in cultivating growth and transformation for myself and others through learning, teaching, volunteering, mentoring and parenting for the last 35 years. It has been my joy and passion to walk beside people on their journey.</p>
